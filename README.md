# scaffold-node

My scaffold for nodejs is built on [Koa](https://github.com/koajs/koa) using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular.js) 
and [ui-router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). It is developed with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io) and [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) 
and written with [babeljs](http://babeljs.io). 

**Clone this repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/aleksichen/scaffold-node.git
cd scaffold-node
npm install
```

**Start the app**

```bash
npm run dev
```

and open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

You can also try the built app:

```bash
npm run build   # First, build for production
npm run prod    # then, run the production version
```

then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


Good luck!
